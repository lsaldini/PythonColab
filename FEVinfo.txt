		Documentation for FEV data
		==========================

It is now widely believed that smoking tends to impair lung function.
Much of the data to support this claim arises from studies of
pulmonary function in adults who are long-time smokers. A question
then arises whether such deleterious effects of smoking can be
detected in children who smoke. To address this question, measures
of lung function were made in 654 children seen for a routine
check up in a particular pediatric clinic. The children participating
in this study were asked whether they were current smokers.

A common measurement of lung function is the forced expiratory
volume (FEV), which measures how much air you can blow out of your 
lungs in a short period of time. A higher FEV is usually associated 
with better respiratory function. It is well known that prolonged 
smoking diminishes FEV in adults, and those adults with diminished 
FEV also tend to have decreased pulmonary function as measured by 
other clinical variables, such as blood oxygen and carbon dioxide 
levels.

The data set FEV (available in multiple formats) contains data on
654 children.
Available data includes measurement of age, height, sex, FEV, and
whether each child smokes or not. The variables are:

SEQNBR = case number
SUBJID = subject identification number
AGE    = subject age at time of measurement (years)
FEV    = measured FEV (liters per second)
HEIGHT = subject height at time of measurement (inches)
SEX    = subject sex (1 = male, 2 = female)
SMOKE  = smoking habits (1 = yes, 2 = no)
